        IndustryDev#6500 ("Industry"), a member of Berezaa Games Discord ("BGD") was unfairly demoted from his position as helper.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As a long time member for almost five years, Industry has been a moderator multiple times for the BGD community. He was recently put as a helper in the community to help try to improve things for everyone.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Today, at 19th of March, 2021, he was kicked from BGD without a given reason. He joined back and realised he had lost both his Helper role and Exemplar. The staff knew the reason, but when asked to give it out, they said they didn't know if they could give it out. A moderator then decided to direct message Industry about what happened and why he was kicked.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        According to Industry, he was considered a "bad influence". The exact reason why is unknown. The person who kicked Industry refuses to give a reason as to why he has shown bad conduct.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Both the moderator and Industry believe that the reason for this termination was because of an event that happened earlier that day. A user was sending content that was again BGD's rules, and was defending himself using the reasoning that "BGD wasn't a workplace, NSFW rules didn't apply." The user was called a retard by Industry and was later banned from BGD.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the discussion with the moderator, Industry felt that he lost connection with BGD. His status of being in BGD for five years will remain five years. He said his goodbyes and left the server.
      </p>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I'm now leaving the server. For good. Thank you guys for a good 5 years. I still dont understand how I have showed bad conduct at all during my time here, but it's whatever honestly. If you guys need me, I'll be in the INN, or the Dorm, or any of the community's other sub-branches or whatever. I wish I could stay and help change this server for the better, but unfortunately, it seems as though some figures don't want that. I wish you guys the best of luck and hope in your future, and please contact me directly if you wish to stay in contact. If you can't DM me, friend me and I'll accept it. That's all I have to say, and that's all I will ever say. 'Till next time. Goodbye.
        </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        But this is just Industry. Other BGD members have recalled moderators and administrators of BGD swearing text and voice chat, sending images that break the rules, and having bias for specific members in general. All of these people are still staff of BGD. So what makes it different if Industry calls someone a name?
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        It's been a good five years, Industry. We'll miss you.
