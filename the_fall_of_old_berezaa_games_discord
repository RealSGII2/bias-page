          Welp. Thanks Tax, you just ruined the server.

        <div>— An ex-moderator of BGD</div>
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <p>
        It's almost BGD's fifth birthday. When it was first started, Berezaa imagined an active community all about fun and games. He appointed moderators and administrators to keep the community sane and safe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Over the years, Berezaa, little by little, started giving up on his own Discord server. The community grew toxic and the moderators inconsistant. The place became a center for negative attention.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        That's when a developer of Miner's Haven named Talon became an administrator. He wanted to make BGD better. He set up new rules, systems, channel layouts, and even coordinated the development for a bot to help with the players of Miner's Haven. Then, all of his and Berezaa's work fell into shambles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the <a href="/">Industry Incident</a>, a user named Taxalotl who had ten infractions (ten was the limit until a temporary ban) and wasn't banned said the server sucks. Why should Industry get this treatment while Taxalotl bypasses the moderation system of BGD?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In Berezaa's words, he was given the moderator role to try and fix the server up. This went way out of plan. Instead, Taxalotl decided to mention @everyone, giving a notifcation, to almost 90,000 users.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Everyone got the notification. They started sending messages all at once, causing massive flood. The moderators locked down the general channels, keeping the channels requiring special roles unlocked.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        That's when Berezaa realised just what happened to his community that he gave up on. The state of it was <em>bad</em>. Berezaa made an announcement, mentioning everyone, for what he plans to do with BGD.
      </p>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Sorry for the chaos you saw today, and for the general state of this server even before today. As you may know, I haven't been very involved with this server for a while, and in my absence a structure emerged that myself and many of you as well have found very... uncomfortable. I don't know about you guys, but I think a Discord server should be fun and games. It should be a place for us to unwind after a long day of putting up with things, a casual and welcoming environment. The Berezaa Games Discord that I purged today was none of these things.
        </p>

      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <p>
        Berezaa removed the moderator or administrator roles from most of the staff team, leaving some people with their original position. Moderators that intended to keep the server in shape were even removed or demoted. Talon and OutOfOrderFoxy were given a "developer" role. An exemplar and two staff members were promoted to administrator that he "can trust to oversee and make sure things are running smoothly." He also plans to remove bots from staff positions, and change up the Moderator role. He wants to be active in his community again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although Taxalotl's actions were seen as destructive by some people, others see this as a new chance for BGD. Most of the community looks up to him. Unfortunately, the ex-administrators of BGD aren't such a big fan of this. Taxalotl was banned from BGD, Miner's Haven 100, and Azure Mines 100 because of his actions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Talon isn't happy with both Taxalotl and Berezaa. His work was undone by Berezaa, and even called "uncomforting". He has decided to go on HIATUS indefinitely and not develop for Miner's Haven. The Third Sacrifice update everyone's been looking for is now delayed, and may even not release.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the eyes of many members, BGD was a good place. In some, not so much. What could happen now that can make these people think differently?
